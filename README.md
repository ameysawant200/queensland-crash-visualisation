# 🚗 Queensland Crash Data Visualization

## 📊 Overview
This project analyzes over 300,000 road crash incidents across Queensland using R to uncover trends in accident frequency, severity, geography, and time. It delivers actionable insights for traffic policy, urban planning, and public safety awareness.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- R (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate)
- Data Cleaning & Wrangling
- Feature Engineering (hour buckets, suburb labels)
- Visual Analytics (bar plots, line charts, geographic heatmaps)

## 📁 Dataset Summary
- Crash severity (Fatal, Hospitalized, Medical, Property Damage)
- Crash time, date, and hour of occurrence
- Suburb, location coordinates
- Weather and road conditions

## 📈 Key Visualizations
1. **Yearly Crash Trend** (2000–2025)
   - Showed steady decline in crashes after 2010
   - Spike in 2021 attributed to COVID-related driving patterns

2. **Crash Severity Breakdown**
   - Most crashes resulted in hospitalization or property damage
   - Fatalities remain low but constant

3. **Suburb-Level Severity Analysis**
   - Southport, Surfers Paradise, and Brisbane City among highest
   - Grouped bar charts highlight severity mix by location

4. **Hourly Crash Frequency**
   - Peaks at 8 AM and 3–5 PM (commute & school traffic)
   - Early morning hours show the lowest crash rates

5. **Geographic Heatmap**
   - Densest clu
